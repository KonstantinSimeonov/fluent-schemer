Aims to provide declarative, expressive and elegant approach to validation, while providing an intuitive, easy-to-use api.

## It's cool, because
- it fully embraces ES2015 features such classes, fat arrow functions, mixins, destructuring statements
- has a fluent, readable and declarative api
- no production dependencies - using `fluent-validator` does not tie you to any other packages
- helps developers get rid of long if-else code blocks
- helps developers reuse validation logic
- extending the validator with a new schema either statically or dynamically is trivial
- the codebase is small - having a problem or just curious? Reading the source code won't be time consuming :)

## It will be cool, because
- every script, that is part of the validator, will eventually be thoroughly unit tested
- will be configurable - the ability to plug in your own base classes, error factories or other options will is a priority
- documentation with detailed examples for many combinations and use cases incoming!
- synchronous validation is already provided, async validation with ES2015 promises coming soon

### Examples
