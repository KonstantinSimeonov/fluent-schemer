## Incoming:
- **flow typedefs**

Aims to provide declarative, expressive and elegant approach to validation, while providing an intuitive, easy-to-use api.

## It's cool, because
- it **fully embraces ES2015** features such as classes, fat arrow functions, mixins, destructuring statements, modules
- has **typescript type definitions** - v2.0 comes with typings for enhanced development experience
- **easy to use and pick up**, write a little code for a lot of common validation logic
- has a **fluent, readable and declarative** api
- **umd compliant** - use in node/browser, with commonjs, umd, script tags, harmony modules, whatever
- **no production dependencies**, small codebase
- helps developers **get rid of imperative code, long if-else's** and writing boring validations all over again
- **promotes code reuse** - easily share code between modules, between clients, servers and across projects
- easy to extends with custom schemas
- **statically type checked** with typescript, checked for correctness with a bunch of **unit tests**
- **throws errors** when rubbish arguments are provided to schema methods, instead of failing silently

## It will be cool, because
- every script, that is part of the validator, will eventually be thoroughly unit tested
- documentation with detailed examples for many combinations and use cases incoming!
- async validation for large arrays/objects is planned

### Running the tests

```
yarn build && yarn test
```
