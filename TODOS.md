# TODO list
- Unit test every schema
	- There are still a lot of repeating steps
	- Tests need to be redesigned
	- Test generation may work
	- How to make the tests more helpful, descriptive and maintainable?
- Unit test sync and async api
	- Would someone ever use an async api?
- Test public api
- Analyze performance
	- Tree shaking would be nice
- Write documentation
	- Decide what to do with JSDoc
- Reduce complexity where possible
	- Doing away with factory functions in schema definitions is an option
- Try out typescript type definitions
	- Or maybe rewrite the whole codebase in typescript?
- Functionality
	- implement recursive types
	- date schema
	- different error reporting strategies
		- Some lazy evaluated thingy might be worth checking out
